    "Working in technology has forced me to evolve into a multi-tasking maestro. However, what’s served me best was never my ability to manage several work streams concurrently, no, it was in my ability to intentionally focus on one single task at a time. Research suggests that constant task-switching can lower productivity by up to 40%. A study from Stanford University found that people who consider themselves adept at multitasking actually perform worse when juggling multiple tasks.\n\nI’ve begun reading through Deep Work by Cal Newport in which he argues that uninterrupted focus is the secret to high-quality, efficient work.\n\nWhy Single-Tasking Works\n\nOur brains aren’t meant to simultaneously handle multiple streams of complex information. Each time we switch tasks, mental energy is wasted reconnecting with the unfinished job. Repeating this process drains the ever-important resource of willpower and increases the risk of making mistakes.\n\nA Simple Strategy I use\n\nPrioritize Tasks: List tasks in order of importance and choose the most important.\n\nTime-Block - Pomodoros: Dedicate specific periods to each task and avoid interruptions.\n\nSet Boundaries: Silence notifications and minimize environmental distractions.\n\nTake Breaks: After each block of focused effort, rest or step away for a moment to recharge.\n\nRepeat: Pick up the next highest priority task from the list and repeat.\n\nSingle-task work blocks may feel counterintuitive in the sometimes chaotic and velocity-first world of software development, but the science and popular literature both show it pays off. By concentrating on one task at a time, you protect your mental energy and are able to deliver your best work.",
